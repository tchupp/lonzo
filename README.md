# Lonzo
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tchupp/lonzo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tchupp/lonzo)

Named for Alonzo Church, *Lonzo* is a really simple parser for mathematical expressions

## Goal

My major motivation for this project is to explore context-free grammars, starting with arithmetic, and eventually adding more complex expressions (using variables, etc.)
